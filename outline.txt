#Outline
This is a project to create a cookbook in python that would store multiple recipes and classify them into different categories.
Create a program that will store the ingredients for a recipe.
-The program should have user to input:
    -recipe name
    -course name
    -cuisine name
    -prep and cook times
    -number of servings
    -list of ingredients:(item, quanitity and units)
-The user should be able to retrieve the recipe and alter the number of servings. The program should output the recipe with revised quanities for requested number of servings.

-import section
    -import os
-generic variable
    -mypaths
-class definition
     -Ingredient: individual ingredient in each recipe.
     -Recipe:
     -Recipe Index:

    	if len(self.name)>0:
            self.quantity = input("Quantity required: ")
            self.unit = input("Unit of measurement: ")

    def combineline(self):
    	return self.name + "|" + self.quantity + self.unit

    def recipeclass(self):
	self.name = ""
